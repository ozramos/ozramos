# **Project Phoenix: A Strategic Roadmap for Career Re-entry**

## **Part I: Forging the Narrative and Building the Assets**

This initial phase is the most critical component of the strategy. Before any applications are submitted, a new professional identity must be constructed. This involves creating the core assets—the portfolio, the professional network profile, and the personal narrative—that will transform a challenging history into a unique and compelling value proposition.

### **The Maverick's Monomyth: Framing Your Unconventional Journey**

The foundation of this strategy is a radical reframing of the past decade. It was not a "career gap"; it was a period of intense, self-directed research and development conducted under extraordinary circumstances. This narrative shift is essential for positioning your experience as a strength.

#### **Deconstructing the "Career Gap"**

Standard career advice for addressing employment gaps often centers on framing them through socially acceptable lenses like parenting, further education, or health challenges.1 While health issues were a factor in your journey, this framework is insufficient to capture the scale and substance of your accomplishments. The conventional wisdom to be "honest but brief" and put a "positive spin" on the time away is a starting point, but your situation demands a more assertive and proactive narrative.1  
This period will be framed as your "Independent Researcher & Innovator" phase. In all professional materials, the narrative will be structured as follows: "Following a period of profound personal disruption, I dedicated my focus to independent research and open-source development. This work culminated in the creation of the Handsfree.js library, contributions to Mozilla's WebXR stack, and participation in early-stage AI residencies." This framing is not only honest but immediately pivots the conversation to high-impact achievements, demonstrating resilience and a relentless drive to build and innovate.

#### **The Narrative of Extreme Resilience**

Your personal history is your most powerful differentiator. It is a testament to a level of intrinsic motivation and grit that cannot be taught or credentialed. A carefully crafted narrative will form the centerpiece of your portfolio's "About Me" section and the opening of your cover letter. This story should not dwell on the specifics of homelessness or psychosis but can allude to "successfully navigating a profound health challenge" 1 or "overcoming significant personal adversity".2 The key is to immediately connect this resilience to tangible, positive outcomes.  
The creation of Handsfree.js, a library that rose to the top of Google's developer library listings, is the primary evidence of this productive period.3 This project, along with its diverse applications in controlling games, robots, and creating art, serves as undeniable proof that this was a time of growth, not stagnation.3 Furthermore, your residency with GPT-2 interns while experiencing homelessness is a stunning data point that establishes your presence at the forefront of the AI revolution long before it entered the mainstream.5 This unique combination of extreme adversity and high achievement will act as a powerful filter. Conservative, bureaucratic organizations may be deterred by a non-linear path. However, innovative R\&D labs, mission-driven organizations, and high-growth startups—the very environments where you are likely to thrive—will be intensely intrigued. The narrative is therefore not a defensive explanation but an offensive tool designed to attract the right kind of employer, one that values raw talent and perseverance over a conventional resume.

#### **Addressing the "Burned Bridges" and Lack of References**

The inability to provide traditional professional references presents a significant obstacle that must be strategically bypassed rather than confronted directly. The solution is to make formal references irrelevant through an overwhelming body of public, verifiable evidence of your skills and impact.  
Your portfolio will become your primary reference. It will be a comprehensive repository of your work, including detailed project case studies, links to active GitHub repositories, and any public testimonials or "shoutouts" from your past work.8 For application forms that have a mandatory field for references, the prepared response should be: "As an independent researcher and open-source developer over the past decade, my work is best represented by my public portfolio and code contributions. Consequently, professional references from this period are not applicable, though I am happy to provide contacts who can speak to my character." This response is professional, direct, and redirects the focus back to your tangible accomplishments.

### **The Digital Doppelgänger: Constructing a Professional Presence**

With the narrative defined, the next step is to build the digital infrastructure that will house it. This includes a professional portfolio website, a validation-focused LinkedIn profile, and a curated GitHub presence.

#### **The Portfolio as Your Primary Credential**

This is the most critical asset in your job search and must be treated as a top-priority project. For a candidate with a non-traditional background, the portfolio is not just a supplement to a resume; it *is* the resume. It is the single most important tool for demonstrating technical ability, problem-solving skills, creativity, and attention to detail.8

* **Platform:** The portfolio must be hosted on a personal domain. As a full-stack developer, the website itself becomes a demonstration of your skills, from server setup to front-end execution.9  
* **Content Strategy:**  
  * **Homepage:** Feature the powerful "Maverick's Monomyth" narrative crafted in the previous section. This immediately frames your story on your terms.  
  * **About Me:** Provide a slightly more detailed version of your narrative, mentioning your core interests (AI, Robotics, HCI, AI Humanities) and linking to your newly created LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.8  
  * **Projects:** This is the core of the portfolio. Each project must be presented as a detailed case study.  
    * ***Handsfree.js:*** This project deserves a deep-dive treatment. Explain the inspiration behind it, the technical architecture (JavaScript, MediaPipe, TensorFlow.js), and its impact (top of Google's devlib, usage in robotics, accessibility tools like face mouses, and art installations).3 Include embedded videos, GIFs of the technology in action, and prominent links to the documentation and GitHub repository.  
    * ***Mozilla WebXR Contributions:*** Frame this as "Collaborating with Mozilla on the future of the immersive web." Detail your specific contributions, even if they were brief. Contributing to a major open-source project like Mozilla's is a significant signal of competence and ability to work within established codebases.13 Link directly to the relevant GitHub repositories or MDN documentation you influenced.15  
    * ***AI Residencies & Early Work:*** Document your residency with GPT-2 interns. This is a crucial point of credibility, demonstrating your early involvement in the large language model space years before tools like ChatGPT became ubiquitous.5 This positions you not as someone catching up with the trend, but as someone who was there at its inception.  
    * ***New Mini-Project:*** To demonstrate current skills and activity, develop one small but polished project in a key area of interest, such as a simple visual programming interface for an AI agent or a novel HCI experiment. Document the process and results thoroughly, showing that you are continuously learning and building.8  
  * **Blog/Writings:** Include a blog section with two or three thoughtful posts. Potential topics could include: "The Future of Hands-Free Interfaces: Lessons from Handsfree.js," "Beyond the Prompt: Designing for Human-AI Collaboration," or "Reflections on AI and Spirituality." This showcases your ability to communicate complex ideas in writing, a critical skill for senior, remote, and research-oriented roles.8

#### **The LinkedIn Dilemma: A Tool for Validation, Not Networking**

While you have no existing social media presence, creating a LinkedIn profile is a necessary defensive measure. The consensus is that not having a profile in 2025 is a "net negative" and can raise red flags for recruiters who use it as a primary tool for vetting candidates.18 The goal is not to build a network or become a content creator, but to have a complete, professional profile that validates your identity and expertise when a hiring manager inevitably searches for your name.20

* **Profile Photo:** A clean, professional headshot is required.  
* **Headline:** This should be direct and keyword-rich: "Senior Software Engineer & Independent Researcher | AI, Human-Computer Interaction, Robotics | Creator of Handsfree.js".  
* **About Section:** Use the core narrative developed in Section 1.1.  
* **Experience Section:** Consolidate the last decade into a single, continuous role:  
  * **Title:** Independent Researcher & Software Engineer  
  * **Company:** Self-Employed / Open-Source Developer  
  * **Dates:** \- Present  
  * **Description:** Detail your major achievements here, treating Handsfree.js, Mozilla contributions, and AI residencies as key projects within this single role. This approach transforms the "gap" into a coherent period of self-directed work.

#### **Curating Your GitHub**

Your GitHub profile is the technical counterpart to your portfolio, providing the raw proof of your coding abilities.9 It should be clean, organized, and focused. Pin your most impressive repositories to the top:  
Handsfree.js, your new mini-project, and any other polished work. Ensure every pinned project has a comprehensive README.md file that explains the project's purpose, how to install and run it, and the technologies used. Your contribution graph should reflect recent activity from the development of your new mini-project.

## **Part II: Identifying and Targeting High-Potential Opportunities**

With your foundational assets constructed, the strategy shifts from defense to offense. The approach is to bypass the high-volume, low-signal generic job boards and focus exclusively on niche ecosystems where your unique profile is an advantage. This requires a narrow and deep search, not a wide and shallow one. The fastest path to a suitable role is not by applying to the most jobs, but by applying only to the *right* jobs through the *right* channels.

### **A Curated Guide to Niche Job Markets**

Your job search should be concentrated in three high-potential areas that are philosophically and technically aligned with your skills and interests.

#### **AI-Specific Job Boards**

These platforms are your primary hunting grounds. Generic sites like Indeed are not suited to your profile. Instead, focus on specialized boards that attract companies specifically seeking advanced AI talent.

* **Key Platforms:** AIJobs.ai, aijobs.net, and the Towards AI job board are hyper-focused on the AI/ML space.21 They list roles such as "Research Engineer," "Machine Learning Engineer," and various specialized developer positions.  
* **Strategy:** While many roles on these boards list Python as a requirement, the "Developer" and "Engineer" categories are rich with opportunities where your JavaScript expertise is a key asset, particularly for teams building the user interfaces, tooling, and visualization layers for complex AI systems.22 To augment this search, leverage a tool like  
  Jobright.ai, which functions as an AI copilot for job searching. Its matching system can analyze your specific skill set (JavaScript, HCI, AI research) and identify roles that may not conform to standard titles, increasing the surface area of relevant opportunities.23

#### **The 80,000 Hours Ecosystem**

This platform aligns directly with your stated values and interest in "AI Humanities." 80,000 Hours is more than a job board; it is a community filtered by a shared philosophy of using one's career to solve the world's most pressing problems.24

* **Organizational Profile:** Companies listed here are often focused on long-term, high-impact areas like AI Safety and biorisk. They tend to value intellectual rigor and a candidate's substance over a conventional resume format.25 The platform explicitly lists "Software and tech skills" as a highly valuable asset for tackling these problems.25  
* **Strategy:** Target "Software Engineer" or "Research Engineer" roles at organizations listed on the board, such as Palisade Research.25 Your unique interest in the intersection of AI and humanities could be a compelling angle for policy, strategy, or research-adjacent roles within this ecosystem.

#### **The Portland "Silicon Forest" Ecosystem**

A focused local strategy provides the opportunity for in-person or hybrid roles, which can be beneficial for re-integrating into a team environment. Portland and the surrounding region have a vibrant and growing technology scene, often referred to as the "Silicon Forest".26

* **Key Players:** The area is home to a mix of established corporations and innovative startups in AI and robotics.27 This includes AI product companies like Foureyes (AI for sales intelligence) and Auxon (AI for system resilience), design and development agencies like Twenty Ideas, and world-class robotics firms.27  
* **Strategy:**  
  * **Prime Target: Agility Robotics.** This company is building a large-scale humanoid robot factory in Salem, OR, placing it at the global forefront of robotics.29 They will have a significant need for engineers working on simulation, control interfaces, and human-robot interaction—all areas where your HCI and software development skills are directly applicable.  
  * **Secondary Targets:** Local AI companies like Synaptiq and Foureyes offer opportunities to work on tangible AI products in smaller, more agile teams that may value your proven ability to build from the ground up.27  
  * **HCI Research Hubs:** Both Oregon State University and the University of Oregon have active HCI research labs.30 OSU in particular has faculty like Heather Knight whose work overlaps with AI and robotics.30 These institutions represent potential avenues for research positions or collaborations.

### **A Taxonomy of Aligned Job Roles**

Rather than applying for generic "Software Engineer" roles, your search should be focused on specific job titles that are exceptionally well-suited to your unique blend of skills.

#### **The Creative Technologist**

This role is the ideal fit for your profile. A Creative Technologist sits at the intersection of design, engineering, and R\&D, focusing on prototyping and experimenting with emerging technologies.

* **Role Description:** Job postings for Creative Technologists explicitly call for skills in rapid prototyping, a deep understanding of new technologies like generative AI, and strong front-end development capabilities.33 Companies like Apple, for example, seek Creative Technologists to develop prototypes of interactive experiences using generative AI and to conduct open-ended research with LLMs and diffusion models.35 These roles value a strong portfolio of experimental work above all else.36  
* **Your Fit:** Your Handsfree.js project is the archetypal Creative Technologist portfolio piece. It is a novel, functional, and creative application of emerging technology. Your resume, portfolio, and LinkedIn headline should be tailored to explicitly use this title.

#### **The HCI / UX Research Engineer**

This is a hybrid role for researchers who can build. Your work on Handsfree.js and face mouses is fundamentally applied HCI research.

* **Role Description:** Companies are increasingly seeking UX professionals who possess strong technical skills to build and test their own prototypes. Job listings in the Portland area and for remote positions show demand for UX designers and researchers with coding knowledge.37 The existence of startups like Micorza, founded by an HCI researcher to build an AI platform, demonstrates a clear career vector in this domain.39  
* **Your Fit:** Frame your past projects as research into novel interaction paradigms for accessibility and control. Target companies that are building complex, user-facing systems, particularly in the fields of AI, data visualization, and robotics.

#### **The Research Engineer (JavaScript/Frontend Focus)**

While many AI research roles are dominated by Python, there is a critical and growing need for engineers who can build the interfaces, tools, and visualizations that make AI research possible and accessible.

* **Role Description:** Job boards show an increasing number of JavaScript-centric roles focused on creating data for training AI models or building the front-end applications for AI products.40 Companies like Notion and Datadog have posted roles for engineers with strong JavaScript skills to work on AI features and security research systems.42  
* **Your Fit:** Your deep expertise in the JavaScript ecosystem is a significant asset, not a liability. Search for "Research Engineer," "AI Engineer," or "Software Engineer" roles that specifically list React, Node.js, or TypeScript as required skills.

#### **The "Returnship" / Non-Traditional Talent Program**

Several major technology companies have created structured, paid, full-time programs designed specifically as on-ramps for individuals with non-traditional backgrounds. These are not junior internships; they are high-potential entry points into senior-track roles.

* **Program Examples:**  
  * **JPMorgan Chase's Emerging Talent Software Engineers Program:** This program is an excellent fit, as it explicitly seeks candidates from diverse backgrounds (including those re-entering the workforce) and provides intensive training and mentorship.43  
  * **Airbnb and Google Apprenticeships:** Both companies offer paid apprenticeships designed for people from non-traditional tech backgrounds.44  
  * **Outreachy:** This program offers paid, remote internships focused on contributing to open-source projects, which aligns perfectly with your experience and demonstrated skills.45  
* **Your Fit:** Your story is precisely what these programs are designed to find. They represent a structured pathway that provides both a challenging role and a supportive environment designed to facilitate re-entry.

## **Part III: The Alternative Path: Securing Funding for Independent Research**

This path runs parallel to the job search. It addresses your desire to work on your own ideas and leverages your proven history of independent innovation. Pursuing grants is not merely a backup plan; it is a synergistic activity that enhances your job candidacy by forcing the crystallization of your ideas into a professional research agenda.

### **From Applicant to Grantee: A Practical Guide to Securing Research Funding**

Your profile makes you an ideal candidate for many research grants. Funding bodies are actively seeking to support individuals who can demonstrate a track record of high-impact, independent work. Your creation of Handsfree.js and your participation in prestigious AI residencies without formal institutional backing are powerful signals of your capability and commitment.6  
The act of preparing a grant proposal is, in itself, a valuable exercise. It produces a high-quality "research agenda" document that can be shared with potential employers in R\&D or advanced technology groups. An applicant who can present a fully-formed, grant-quality research proposal demonstrates a level of strategic thinking, vision, and initiative that sets them far apart from the typical candidate.

## **Part IV: Synthesis and Action Plan**

This roadmap provides the strategy; this section provides the tactical execution plan. The following is a concrete, 90-day schedule designed to build momentum and achieve the primary goal of securing a challenging, well-compensated role.

### **The First 90 Days: A Step-by-Step Action Plan**

#### **Weeks 1-4: Asset & Narrative Construction**

The initial month is dedicated entirely to building your professional toolkit. No applications should be submitted during this phase.

* **Day 1:** Purchase a domain name for your portfolio website.  
* **Week 1:** Draft the core "Maverick's Monomyth" narrative. Use this narrative to create your minimalist but complete LinkedIn profile. Clean up your GitHub profile, pin key repositories, and ensure all have excellent README.md files.  
* **Weeks 2-4:** This is an intensive development sprint. Build the portfolio website from scratch. Write the comprehensive Handsfree.js case study. Simultaneously, develop and document your new, small-scale mini-project to demonstrate current activity. Write and publish the first of your three planned blog posts.

#### **Weeks 5-8: Targeted Applications & Grant Proposal Draft**

With your assets in place, the focus shifts to targeted outreach.

* **Week 5:** Begin systematically scanning the niche job boards identified in Part II (aijobs.ai, 80000hours.org, etc.). Search for the specific roles outlined (Creative Technologist, Research Engineer). Identify a shortlist of 5-10 top-tier opportunities that are a strong fit.  
* **Week 6:** Select the top 3 roles from your shortlist. For each one, tailor your resume and write a unique, powerful cover letter that leads with your narrative and directly addresses the needs outlined in the job description. Submit these three high-quality applications.  
* **Weeks 7-8:** Begin drafting a full grant proposal for your primary independent research idea. Use the NSF or GovAI guidelines as a template. This document will serve as a powerful talking point in interviews, showcasing your vision and strategic thinking.

#### **Weeks 9-12: Interviewing, Networking & Iteration**

This phase is about engagement and refinement.

* **Interview Preparation:** Prepare to discuss your story and projects with confidence. Rehearse your narrative. Be ready to give a live, compelling demonstration of your portfolio and Handsfree.js.  
* **Passive Networking:** Identify one or two online communities (e.g., a relevant Discord server for AI/HCI, the Effective Altruism forum) and begin to participate passively. Answer questions where you have expertise. The goal is not to ask for a job, but to build a presence and let opportunities emerge organically.  
* **Continuous Application:** Continue to apply to 1-2 highly-targeted, top-tier roles per week. Quality over quantity is the rule. For any rejections, professionally request feedback to iterate on your approach.  
* **Grant Submission:** If a relevant grant deadline from your curated list is approaching, finalize and submit your proposal. This action, regardless of the outcome, is a victory in itself, marking a concrete step in your parallel path as an independent researcher.
