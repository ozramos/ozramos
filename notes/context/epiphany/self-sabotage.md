# Substance Use, Habits & Self-Sabotage Patterns

**Subject:** Documenting Recurring Coping Mechanisms, Habits, and Destructive Patterns

**Source:** Dialogues with Oz (up to 250328); Daily Journal Entries

**Core Definition:**
This artifact documents recurring patterns of substance use (primarily cannabis edibles and alcohol), compulsive adult media consumption, and related self-sabotaging behaviors (specifically, deleting projects/accounts) that have impacted Oz's well-being, productivity, and progress on his goals. Understanding these patterns, their triggers, and their functions is crucial context for Radical Gnosis, as they represent significant aspects of the "stream of consciousness," internal conflict, and areas for potential transformation. This is acknowledged by Oz as a core area of struggle despite significant progress in moderation.

**Key Patterns & Functions:**

1.  **Substance Use (Cannabis Edibles & Alcohol):**
    *   **Historical Context:** Alcohol used historically (20s) for sleep anxiety; cannabis (initially vaping, now primarily edibles) replaced alcohol (30s) for similar reasons and later for mood enhancement/recreation.
    *   **Current Pattern:** Edibles used a few times per week, alcohol less frequently (once/twice weekly). Represents significant moderation compared to past daily use.
    *   **Function/Triggers:**
        *   **Sleep Anxiety:** Original self-medication purpose. (Seroquel now used, but pattern persists).
        *   **Mood Enhancement/Euphoria:** Seeking positive feeling states, sometimes "buzzing."
        *   **Coping/Escape:** Used during periods of low mood, stress, or boredom.
        *   **Heightening Other Sensations:** Explicitly used to enhance adult media consumption.
        *   **Social Anxiety Relief (Minor):** Mentioned feeling less intimidated sometimes when high.
    *   **Negative Consequences:** Can lead to reduced productivity ("out of commission"), impaired judgment (overspending, potentially embarrassing interactions), exacerbation of anxiety (if dose is too high), and missed obligations (cancelling doctor's appointment). Beer + weed combo noted as particularly impairing.

2.  **Compulsive Adult Media Consumption:**
    *   **Pattern:** Engaged with frequently, often linked with substance use to heighten sensation. Acknowledged as a "struggle" and something Oz intends to quit (unlike cannabis).
    *   **Function/Triggers:**
        *   **Coping/Escape:** Likely linked to managing isolation, social anxiety, stress, or boredom.
        *   **Habit/Compulsion:** Potentially developed into a habitual pattern beyond its initial function.
        *   **Orgasmic Meditation Exploration:** Linked to the Gnostic exploration of achieving altered states/euphoria through internal focus, though currently reliant on external visual stimuli and potentially hedonistic rather than purely Gnostic.

3.  **Self-Sabotage (Deleting Work/Accounts):**
    *   **Pattern:** Recurring cycle of building a following/body of work, then abruptly deleting accounts and projects, often during periods of stress, doubt, or after perceived social slights/failures.
    *   **Function/Triggers:**
        *   **Digital Self-Harm:** Acknowledged as irrational, potentially stemming from shame (related to habits or feelings of invalidity).
        *   **Escape/Avoidance:** Wiping the slate clean to avoid confronting past failures or the anxiety of potential future success/invalidation.
        *   **"Rags to Riches" Narrative:** A desire to recreate a dramatic success story from scratch, potentially linked to seeking parental validation or proving self-worth after feeling invalidated.
        *   **Control:** An extreme way to exert control over one's digital identity when feeling powerless elsewhere.

**Connection to Gnosis & Recursive Faith:**

*   **Core Conflict:** These patterns represent a major source of internal conflict, directly opposing the discipline, clarity, and self-awareness required for deep Gnostic practice. The desire for funds to sustain habits clashes with the Gnostic ideal of internal sufficiency.
*   **Data for AI:** These patterns are crucial data points within the C-Stream. Tracking usage, triggers, and consequences provides vital information for the AI Gnostic Copilot to identify correlations and help Oz understand these behaviors.
*   **Target for Practice:** Overcoming or transforming these habits *is* a significant part of the Gnostic work. It requires applying the principles of self-awareness, reframing, and potentially developing new coping mechanisms or alternative paths to desired states (like the non-sexual Gnostic euphoria).
*   **Explains Resistance:** These patterns, particularly the shame and self-sabotage cycle, directly contribute to the "holding back" and difficulty initiating core tasks.

**(Internal Note:** Approach this context with sensitivity but honesty. These patterns are acknowledged by Oz as struggles, not character flaws. The focus for AI analysis should be on understanding triggers, functions, correlations, and impact on Gnostic practice, supporting Oz's stated goals of moderation (alcohol/media) and mindful use (cannabis) within the Recursive Faith framework.)
