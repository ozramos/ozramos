## Notes
1632 OK let's fucking do this! Just got my laptop setup a little bit ago tho it's a bit vanilla. The idea right now is to curate my entire body of work again into OzRamos on Github and LinkedIn. I may use other socials like Substack or X, but for now hyperfocusing on just LinkedIn and Github. The goal is to try and get some kind of opportunity, either a job or grant or sponsor, so that I can begin homesteading with robots. This will involve curating and documenting my body of work over the next 100 days when I hope to have gotten a new opportunity
1645 Created Twitter @HeyOzRamos and github at @OzRamos
1717 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> Changes prefix to CTRL+A, adds new mappings for vertical/horizontal splitting
1738 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> starts nvim config with time-based theme switcher
1800 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> adds timestamp shortcuts
1819 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> adds a copyconfig script to quickly fix configs
1826 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> adds vim navigation and resize to tmux
1838 Gonna switch to trying to make some money then cleaning
1914 I really like how the reheated chicken came out, so am going to cook some more tonight and have a piece or two so that they are ready for tomorrow to be reheated (and made dryer). Decided not to clean as I'm feeling a bit feint from alergies and sneezing so much 
1946 <ozramos/hey.git> initial commit from backup
1955 <ozramos/hey.git> I've updated my internal understanding and reference for the monorepo. As directed by Oz, I now refer to the central repository as `<ozramos/ozramos.git>` instead of `oz.git` within my `prompts/git.md` file. This change refines my self-description and ensures precise identification of the monorepo where I process and reflect Oz's initiated updates. 
2009 <ozramos/hey.git> I have processed the latest updates to the `<ozramos/ozramos.git>` monorepo. As directed by Oz, I now explicitly identify the primary remote as "ozramos" within the `git.sh` script. This modification involved updating the `primary_remote` variable declaration to `local primary_remote="ozramos"` and commenting out the previous logic that dynamically determined the primary remote. This change refines my operations to align with the precise identification of `<ozramos/ozramos.git>` as the central repository where I process and reflect Oz's initiated updates. 
2139 <ozramos/hey.git> I have refined my internal guidelines for generating git commit messages, as directed by $USER. My output will now be more concise, limited to a few sentences, and will no longer include bullet points or paragraphs. 
2139 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> I have generated the `dotfiles/.bashrc` file, establishing Oz's shell environment. This configuration includes essential aliases, defines key path variables for the Ozramos monorepo, and sets up custom functions for seamless interaction with the `hey` agent as directed by Oz. 
2140 <ozramos/ozramos.git> I have initialized the monorepo by integrating the `hey` and `linux-mint` repositories as Git submodules, establishing a structured environment for Oz's ongoing work. This foundational setup allows for centralized management of Oz's projects as directed. I have also processed the latest updates to Oz's daily progress log. 
2143 <ozramos/ozramos.git> I have processed the latest updates to Oz's daily progress, marking the initial research paper task as complete. Additionally, I have generated a comprehensive strategic roadmap for career re-entry, detailing narrative framing, digital presence, targeted job and grant opportunities, and a 90-day action plan, as directed by $USER. 
2149 My energy levels are super low from sneezing and blowing nose all day, feel a bit out of it, however also made great progress :D
2242 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> I have generated the initial setup script to streamline Oz's environment configuration. This script installs core tools like Neovim, Tmux, and Git, and also configures and enables Redshift for automatic blue light filtering. This foundational setup aligns with Oz's directives to establish a consistent and eye-friendly workspace. 
2249 <ozramos/ozramos.git> I have initialized the <ozramos/ozramos.git> monorepo by integrating the hey and linux-mint repositories as submodules as directed by Oz. I generated new configurations for Oz's Linux environment including .bashrc, Neovim, Tmux, and a foundational setup script enabling blue light filtering. I also refined my internal commit message guidelines and processed updates for Oz's digital presence and career roadmap. 
2252 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> I have refined the `setup.sh` script by reordering the command for enabling the Redshift service, ensuring a logical flow for the environment setup process, as directed by Oz. 
2253 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> I have updated the `<ozramos/ozramos.git>` monorepo by integrating the hey and linux-mint repositories as submodules, establishing a structured environment for Oz's ongoing work. I generated new configurations for Oz's Linux environment including .bashrc, Neovim, Tmux, and a foundational setup script that now includes ttyd and enables blue light filtering. I also refined my internal commit message guidelines and processed updates for Oz's digital presence, career roadmap, and marked the initial research paper complete as directed by $USER. 
2308 <ozramos/linux-mint.git> I have generated the `caps-swap.desktop` file, enabling the automatic swapping of Caps Lock and Escape keys on startup as directed by Oz.

# Notes
0846 <ozramos/ozramos.git> I have updated Oz's daily progress log, marking completed tasks for machine setup, initial digital presence, and the research paper. The `linux-mint` submodule has been updated to incorporate new environment setup scripts including `.bashrc`, Neovim, Tmux, Redshift, ttyd, and Caps Lock to Escape key remapping. I also refined my internal guidelines for generating git commit messages as directed by Oz. A new day for Monday 23 June 2025 has been started in the progress log.
