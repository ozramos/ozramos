# Notes
1632 OK let's fucking do this! Just got my laptop setup a little bit ago tho it's a bit vanilla. The idea right now is to curate my entire body of work again into OzRamos on Github and LinkedIn. I may use other socials like Substack or X, but for now hyperfocusing on just LinkedIn and Github. The goal is to try and get some kind of opportunity, either a job or grant or sponsor, so that I can begin homesteading with robots. This will involve curating and documenting my body of work over the next 100 days when I hope to have gotten a new opportunity
1645 Created Twitter @HeyOzRamos and github at @OzRamos
